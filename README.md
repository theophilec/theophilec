# Hi there, I'm Theophile Cantelobre

I'm an engineer and machine learning PhD passionate about ML, software and community.

## ü§ù Open to work

After a post-PhD break, I am looking for a role as an software engineer in a data or ML product company. Reach out if you are looking for a `{"data scientist", "ML engineer", "AI engineer"}`!

## üî≠ What I'm Currently Working On
Currently trying my hand at web scraping to automate a bunch of menial tasks in my duties at [Mines Paris Alumni](https://mines-paris.org). These are in private repositories for now...

Recently, I worked on a [browser extension](https://github.com/theophilec/giskard-red-challenge-helper) to help me beat a LLM red-teaming challenge. Before that, I have been working on my [PhD thesis](https://github.com/theophilec/thesis), for example [diffy](https://github.com/theophilec/diffy).

I am trying to write a blog at [theophilecantelob.re](https://theophilecantelob.re).
