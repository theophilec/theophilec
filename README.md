# Hi there, I'm Theophile Cantelobre

I'm an engineer and machine learning PhD passionate about ML, software and community.

## ü§ù Open to work

After a post-PhD break, I am looking for a role as an software engineer in a data or ML product company. Reach out if you are looking for a `{"(full stack) data scientist", "ML engineer", "AI engineer"}`!

## What I'm Currently Working On

Some things I have been working on lately:

* a few automation projects [Mines Paris Alumni](https://mines-paris.org) using simple webapps and scraping. These are in private repositories for now...

* a [knowledge graph](https://github.com/theophilec/foudinge) about French restaurants and chefs.

* a [link-checker in a browser extension](https://github.com/theophilec/slinky) hitting a wall with WASM...

* a [browser extension](https://github.com/theophilec/giskard-red-challenge-helper) to help me beat a LLM red-teaming challenge. Before that, I have been working on my [PhD thesis](https://github.com/theophilec/thesis), for example [diffy](https://github.com/theophilec/diffy).

I try to document what I learn and do on [theophilecantelob.re](https://theophilecantelob.re).
